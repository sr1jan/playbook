[["index.html", "Community Building Playbook Hey there!", " Community Building Playbook Hey there! This playbook is incomplete. In our quest to help communities maximise their potential, we couldn’t help but try and understand how communities work at a deeper level. What dynamics govern them? How does an average community evolve over time? And, most importantly, how does one start a community around an interest or a goal? To answer these questions, we started putting together this community building playbook as a public good. And we invite you to co-create it with us! Distilling community building to a formula is no simple task, and it is also not our intention here. We aim to, instead, open a two-way dialogue with the reader, and discuss the general direction we should walk in. As a result, this public good may seem incomplete. In fact, it shall always be so. As participants in communities, we are all well aware of the infinite ways through which communities rise and fall. Further, technological developments have always added layers on this process which breaks certains ground rules and introduces new ones. For example, the rules of building a decentralized, digital community are slightly different from building one irl. Standing in the third decade of the 21st century, we continue to witness the meteoric rise of these digital communities. The rest of this book discusses their peculiarities, as well as highlights concepts and practices that have seemed to work so far. We invite you to share your experiences so we may refine this playbook, and make it the ideal launchpad for the community builders of tomorrow. We have taken an evolutionary approach and have divided a community’s lifecycle into four distinct stages. Then, we have introduced concepts and exercises relevant to each specific stage. Before you begin, we highly recommend you to reflect upon any communities you are a part of. Doing this will maximise the value you get from playbook. How do you feel as a member of that community? What makes it tick? What’s one thing you don’t like? How could it be made better? Take a few minutes to think about that, and feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below! "],["wow-big-changes-super-pog-testing-travis.html", "WOW, BIG CHANGES, SUPER POG, TESTING TRAVIS The Imperative of Our Times Taking a Closer Look What sustains a community? The Illusion of Control Moving Forward", " WOW, BIG CHANGES, SUPER POG, TESTING TRAVIS Together is a wonderful place to be. — Dwayna Litz Computer Chronicles — The Internet (1993) The Imperative of Our Times The Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link, or The WELL is one of the oldest virtual communities still operational. Launched in 1985, in just 8 short years, it grew to 7,000 members and a staff of 12 full-time employees with a gross annual income of $2 million. These are interesting statistics, considering the fact that the foundations of modern day internet — that enable such communities — didn’t exist then. One participant of The WELL, Howard Rheingold, wrote a book aptly titled The Virtual Community, where he discussed the vagaries of life pertaining to online communities. The book’s prescience is uncanny. Almost three decades later, Howard’s observations have become reality. People addicted to communicating online, trolling each other, coordinating together for a greater cause and even finding love — these were as common occurences back then as they are now. What’s more interesting though, was the focus of Howard’s work. He wanted to investigate what made a stream of digital messages, turn into a community as good as any other. When conversation is stripped of its social cues, how does one create the feeling of warm connection with words? This series of articles on community building aims to answer this very question in ample detail. Exiting the domains of Big Tech, people today are increasingly turning away from mindless consumption. In a world of remote everything, people are seeking and creating communities that do things. Be it WSB traders, DAO contributors or activists in Signal groups, the meta of the times has been participating and growing communities. This could attributed partly to the nature of things — narratives that provide meaning to people’s lives have withered, leading to increased isolation. What was once a family sharing one TV, is now everyone sitting separately with their own screens. Technology has gone from a facilitator of “real-life” activity, to a replacement of the same. As a result, we are now finding meaning in these screens, which has turned participating and growing virtual communities consequential for our well-being. Taking a Closer Look There are several peculiarities to virtual communities. They are like streams of data, sustained by prompt replies, a medium where multiple people can talk at the same time and still make sense. Despite this, owing to the constancy of human nature, virtual communities aren’t much different from “real-life” communities. They each have their set of participatory and initiation rituals, and a set of rules that facilitate the integration of new people as well as the exit of the old. They also go through the same stages of growth — ones that we will discuss in more detail in the upcoming articles — and face some of the same issues. To be best prepared to understand and tackle these issues, we must take a closer look at some of the key ideas behind communities. Communities are Gestalts Great communities are gestalts, providing members with value they cannot access or create on their own. This is best witnessed in our usage on social media. A great chunk of the value of web2 social media, especially of UGC applications such as TikTok, Instagram or YouTube lie in the communities they foster. The comments sections of each post indirectly add to your experience of consuming that piece of content. You may be able to consume that content elsewhere, but you certainly won’t get the same value out of doing so. web2 social media comments sections — content can be consumed anywhere, but the community is only on the platform. Communities are Living Beings The best communities are participatory and emergent, and the best community builders are approach their work as gardeners instead of builders. Taking this analogy forward, a great way to think about communities are thinking about slime molds. That is to say, a community is never “complete”. It will always be messy and ever-evolving, and each stage of it is beautiful in its own right. Slime Mold Grows Network Just Like Tokyo Rail System Communities are Spaces Objectively seen, communities create spaces. A space is defined by its boundaries and rules, that classifies everyone into in-groups and out-groups. The primary purpose of a space is to maintain a certain atmosphere for the people within, not the exclusion of those outside of it. This is a key concept to grasp. The latter definition leads to weak communities with extrinsically motivated members (inclusion in the group makes them look good). The former definition leads to strong communities with intrinsically motivated members (inclusion in the group makes them feel good). What sustains a community? Your community’s garden must be tended to regularly. These are key activities that sustain communities in the long-run. Narrative Building Communities that achieve things have compelling narratives greater than any one individual. It is a north-star that attracts the right kind of people, and facilitates decision-making and coordinated action. The only thing more important than a compelling narrative though, is the ability for members to contribute to it. Fortunately, the nature of virtual communities facilitates discussion and enables groups to collectively decide and act on agreed-upon goals. The strongest communities encourage members to “take the story forward”. Sharing Power Just like how a gardener must be careful in placing seeds to ensure all of them have a healthy growth, similarly community stewards must be mindful to give each member the space to fully grow. This means giving each member the opportunity to “take charge”, and to cultivate a space that takes everyone’s opinions into consideration at all times. Today, the lines between a customer, contributor and a community member are more blurred than ever. Communities that acknowledge invisible power dynamics and address them go the furthest. Iterative Processes As communities grow, it becomes more and more difficult to arrive at consensus and actually get stuff done. That is why, iterative processes that focus on regular output do a great job of closing the loop and fighting stagnation. For this, a mindset of “good enough” is better than “the best”. Good enough work, iterated upon, has a higher chance of achieving its true potential, than work that is painstakingly created trying to perfect every detail (or even just a few). There was a fellow who kind of ran the mailing list, who died a few years ago by the name of Jon Postel, and everybody trusted him to not be in a particular faction. So I think the philosophy behind the people who created the internet was rough consensus and running code. So rough consensus is important, because anyone who’s participated in a consensus based activities that are strict consensus, finds that they go on and on and on. The Illusion of Control Around the same time as The WELL, the first iterations of a metaverse were created by Lucasfilm in Habitat. Users controlled their avatar that moved around in a virtual world. In a paper published by the programmers of Lucasfilm Habitat, titled The Lessons of Lucasfilm’s Habitat, Chip Morningstar and F. Randall Farmer talked about designing and managing this virtual community of tens of thousands of people. Their main lesson from working on the project was follows: …*detailed central planning is impossible; don’t even try it. Create the tools for users to build their own society, and let the users tell you what they want to do, because that is what the users…will do, no matter how hard you try to structure some other purpose. The more people we involved in something, the less in control we were. We shifted into a style of operations in which we let the players themselves drive the direction of the design. This proved far more effective. Instead of trying to push the community in the direction we thought it should go, an exercise rather like herding mice, we tried to observe what people were doing and aid them in it.* &gt; As community stewards, our job is set the necessary context and background for a community to flourish. In the beginning, it may feel like you are in control since nothing happens that makes you feel otherwise. But as your community grows, you realize that the only way to reconcile the ensuing chaos is to give up any idea of control, and aid the community to do what it wants to do. A fractal view of belonging Moving Forward Any community goes through four key stages in its lifecycle. This series has four more articles, each concerned with one of the four stages. In this piece, we touched upon the history of virtual communities, our learnings from these experiments, and key approaches to thinking about growing communities. We must look at any community as a garden — an organic space that is ever-evolving and ever-changing. We need to have a compelling narrative that members can contribute to. We need to consciously make an effort to share power, and always favour what’s “good enough” over “what’s perfect”. So how does such a approach to community building look like? In the following posts, we shall go into the weeds, introducing new concepts, walking you through tactical exercises and informing you about key roadblocks to expect and watch out for. LFG! "],["phase-1-the-desert.html", "Phase 1: The Desert Setting the Stage Time to Perform! Common Roadblocks Conclusion", " Phase 1: The Desert The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. — Laozi This desert might seem familiar. Phase 1 of any community is best defined as wandering in the desert. The “community” has three or fewer members. It could also just be you, an idea that isn’t fully fleshed-out yet, and a lot of confusion. Setting the Stage The best thing to do at this stage is to establish key operating behaviours and mental frames of mind that will help you recruit the first believers to your mission. Creating a Space All interactions create a space. The atmosphere of this space is set by the nuances and details of the interaction. Let’s take an example from our daily lives. The space created when a group of friends get together, is very different from the space created when they meet each other individually. This is because inspite of inhabiting the shared space (as members of a group), their individual interactions have vastly different details and nuances. When the details and nuances of an interaction is consistent, the space has a constant atmosphere that fosters bonding. When these are inconsistent, we see the breakdown of a group in several sub-groups where interactions are consistent. By being objective and intentional in your interactions, you increase the chance of maintaining a consistent atmosphere. This has a positive effect that compounds over-time. Building a Narrative Communities exist because they fill a void that members can’t fill themselves. This could be doing something ambitious, feeling seen and heard, exploring interests further, or anything else. Ambitious goals require teams of people to achieve them. Feeling seen and heard requires attentive ears and a safe space. Exploring interests requires exposure to experts and beginners alike that unlocks new perspectives and a deeper understanding. All of this is only possible in communities, never alone. A clear narrative easily conveys the value members can expect to get from the community. It also does a great job of setting the right expectations and separating people who are casually interested from those that are genuinely interested. Approaching Work The best way to think about growing a community is raising a child. Everything you teach them needs to be constantly updated and reinforced. Simply saying something once isn’t enough. You must make an effort every single day to emphasise your values till they get embedded in the “space”, and you must prepare and address the needs of today. This means that your approach to working in your community must be very intentional. Since there is a high chance that your community is mostly online and exists solely in the communication channels, it is imperative to maintain a certain objectivity and clarity in your communications. Time to Perform! Activity 1: How do you show up to yourself? ℹ️ Creating Spaces Remember, the point of a space is to create an atmosphere that is conducive to operating in and growing your community. This means it starts with you, at the individual level. The way you show up to yourself and your various roles is the way you show up to your community. Observing yourself as a group and noticing the various interactions is quite revealing. This is evident when you say, “this part of me wants X, but this part of me wants Y.” Write down the various parts that make “you”. These could be the roles you play (a friend, a parent, a teacher, etc.) Or your various motivations and desires (I really want to read this book, but I also want to go out with my friends). Notice the interactions between these various parts. Are you combative or collaborative? (for example, do you often resolve conflicting desires with harsh words like “No, we will not do this!” or in some other way?) When you favour a certain part, is it out of domination or a place of understanding? (for example, the teacher in you wants to reprimand the disruptive student, but the friend in you wants to laugh at what they said.) If there are others in your community at this moment, get everyone to do this exercise individually and share the results with each. It will not only deepen your understanding of each other, but it will also help in communicating better. Activity 2: What are you getting people excited about? ℹ️ Building narratives A strong narrative is like insurance. Its true value revealed in dire times. A good narrative keeps community members intrinsically motivated and attracts new members at the same time. “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Ideally, you want your community to grow because there is something you cannot do alone. What is this? Create a one-line summary that explicitly states your goals and motivations. “I want to be surrounded by people that share my niche interest of X.” Now imagine for a minute that you successfully gathered these kind of people. What kind of work wil l you do together? What will that lead to? “A group of people that share this interest will get together and A, B and C activities, that will have a P, Q and R effect on the world. The effect you will have on the world becomes your narrative. So, if I am surrounded by people that share my niche interest in Pokemon, then we shall participate in and conduct events, fund relevant projects and contribute to the franchise by creating content. This will introduce a wider audience to our interest, and provide them with community and entertainment. The above, distilled into your narrative becomes — we are expanding the pokemon fandom around the world. Remember, the best narratives evolve with community participation. So while you must put in some thought, do not spend too much time here. There is a high chance that as your community grows, it will collectively decide to focus on something that slightly different, or even completely different. Activity 3: Spreading the word. Now that you have clarity, create a content strategy that revolves around your narrative and start posting on Twitter, Lens and Farcaster to begin with. Activity 4: How do you participate in your community? ℹ️ Working smart Setting a healthy, intentional approach to working goes a very, very long way. It is indeed tempting to “just get it done” when it’s just you or you and a couple others. But not spending time on this is like extending a line of credit which will be due once your community grows. Having said that, it’s the early stages, so clarity and brevity is important. Making a laundry list of rituals, values and processes will backfire, and dilute any existing motivation you have. It is therefore ideal to stick to just a few — think really hard about what you care about — and then be open to changing or adding to these as your community grows. Discover the core value(s) of your community. Everyone and every group has some set of values that they never compromise on. These could be explicit or implicit. Try to notice the patterns in yourself and those around you. Do you try to finish things as soon as you can? Are you over-communicative in your interactions? Do you try to be thorough in everything you do? Do you tolerate ambiguity well? It is easier to notice the patterns in others than yourself. If it’s just you right now, ask your friends and families about ways to describe you. Consciously set rituals. Rituals bring a sense of stability to a community. Good rituals make members feel heard, and indirectly direct member behaviour. Ideally, you should an initiation ritual and a connection ritual. Initiation rituals define how you welcome new members to your community. Ideally, this should be a two-way interaction. For example, new members must collect a Mirror post and introduce themselves to the group collectively. On the other side, all members must make an effort to individually reach out to the new member. The best initiation rituals are memorable. For example, you could have all your existing members change their Twitter profile picture to that of the new member for a week. Who said it can’t be fun? A connection ritual bonds community members outside of the context of “work”. Good connection rituals manage expectations of members. This could be a weekly call where members take turns to share what’s on their mind — Did anything unexpected happen in your interactions this week? is there something insignificant that is bothering you? Maybe the way someone replied or something they did that is trivial but made you make a note of it. Was participating in this community this week an exciting challenge or a daunting task? Activity 5: Create your manifesto. Your community narrative and your values make up your manifesto. If you have done the above exercises diligently, it won’t take long to prepare this. Next, create a collectable Mirror post of this manifesto (ideally free) and personally send it to all your existing Twitter followers. Common Roadblocks For the love of the immortal snail Communities in the beginning are ideas, and ideas die a slow death. Keeping your community alive requires consistent effort to keep the idea alive. This is harder than it seems. When there’s just one, two or three people, everyone’s behaviours and outlook has an outsized impact on the team’s motivation. The good days are really good and the bad days are really bad. So all challenges in this stage pertain to maintaining motivation. The only way to navigate this phase thus is to rigorously uphold your values, and religiously take part in rituals. This will ground you and help you maintain a baseline level of motivation to keep the idea alive at all times. Take an iterative approach to everything and focus on doing good enough instead of doing perfect. Iterations just feel good, and keep the morale high. Think of it like taking the stairs vs. jumping directly. The latter is no doubt faster, and sometimes more fun, but it might break your legs, and is definitely not a strategy for the long run.. Conclusion By now, you should have set the stage to spread your mission and recruit early believers. You have a clear idea of what you are doing and a sustainable, healthy way of working and growing your community. You also have a tiny presence on social media (like Twitter, Farcaster and Lens) and a manifesto that introduces the world to your community. Hopefully, the bedrock of your community strengthens over time and you chip off at work, one day at a time, one task at a time. Eventually, there comes a point when your team starts growing. You slowly double in size and reach a team of five or six people. Things change — some for the better, some for the worse — and you need to keep up with this. Let’s learn how. "],["phase-2-the-valley.html", "Phase 2: The Valley CONTRIBUTOOOOOOORRRRRR Time to Perform! Common Roadblocks Conclusion", " Phase 2: The Valley “A stupid man cries at his torn pockets, a wise man uses it to scratch his balls.” — George Bush McMurdo Dry Valleys Phase 2 is best defined as the dip. Your intial enthusiasm and energy has slowly worn off and you’re motivations are getting tested by the day. Sure, you are not stumbling in the dark — you know where you’re going and you have a strong team of five or six members that have made tangible progress. But things have suddenly become complex and have taken a different shape. You are now in the valley. CONTRIBUTOOOOOOORRRRRR The meta of navigating the valley is addressing the newfound complexity in your community. This comes in two forms — the first is internal complexity. Your community has essentially doubled in size, which has increased coordination costs. Arriving at consensus takes longer, and you might see in-groups forming in your community. The second is external complexity. All the context you set in the beginning — while important to reach here — now stands questioned. For example, your narrative might not have had the impact you expected it to, or it may have attracted those that are more interested in spectating rather than participating. Here are some frameworks and concepts to keep in mind as you navigate the valley. Foster your community The first outside people to join your community are special because they were attracted by the potential of your community, and not its actual progress or impact. Joining a community at this stage implies high levels of intrinsic motivation, since they are few to no external benefits or bragging rights of joining any community so early. At this stage, it is of utmost importance to speak to the intrinsically motivated parts of your members than the extrinsically motivated parts. This is best done by highlighting and appreciating each member individually and publicly for their contributions. At the same time, you should put some effort into defining different ways people could get involved to reduce the distance from a new member to an active contributor. Such pathways provide templates to collect social capital, which makes people spring to action. The open source community is a wonderful example of this. Since practically all issues are open and all PRs can are default visible, members visibly collect social capital by contributing to repositories, with the ultimate validation coming in the form of a merged pull request. Set decision making processes As communities scale, attaining a perfect consensus gets exponentially tougher. But most of the times a perfect consensus isn’t even needed. Time that’s arguing about the theoretical best decision is actually traded-off for concretely slower execution. Therefore, a good enough decision making process is often sufficient. What does this look like, though? Well, a decision making process focussed on schelling points is a sufficient strategy for most communities. In reality, each individual has a different way of calculating the cost vs. benefit of specific decisions. So it is difficult to have everyone agree upon the “best” outcome to choose/vote for. Instead, if everyone based their decision on what they think everyone else will choose, consensus is arrived at faster. Having a consistent, clear North star, i.e. your community’s goal agreed upon goal, also makes decision-making much easier. (link to phase 1, creating narratives) Conflict Resolution If you have been working hard, you have probably already seen an intense disagreement or two in your community. Depending on how agreeable your members are, this would have either ended in reluctant giving in followed by both parties holding grudges, or a massive blow-up that created a rift in your community. But conflict is not necessarily a bad thing! If anything, it is a sign that people care. This is the right stage to create a ritual, a process around conflict resolution. The focus of this should always be on reconciliation of the differing factions, never an investigation or a judgement of who was at fault. This is also a right time to set formal rules around inter-personal behaviour in your community. While an inclusive conflict resolution process is great for matters pertaining to the community at large, you need a slightly different approach to inter-personal conflicts that leave either party with the inability to full express themselves. A good start is for the leaders, i.e. the initiators of the community to hold a safe space where members can come forth and share their concerns, no matter how trivial or grave. Time to Perform! The valley is defined by the exponential increase in the complexity of everything. It may feel things are tougher than what you expected them to be. This is normal. Finish the following activities to maintain your sanity when the going gets tough. Fostering community Fostering your community is best seen from various perspectives. Activity 6: Where does your community reside? The first order of business is creating a formal, shared space where you community can congregate. Clean up or create a new Discord server. Have different channels for different purposes. Ideally, you need to start with the fewest number of channels and only add more when existing channels are overflowing with activity. Having too many channels with little to no activity makes your server seem dead. This means you should have a general channel where anyone can come and message. A gm channel where everyone sends daily gm’s, and an off-topic channel to share memes, music/TV show recs, discuss interests, etc. In addition to this, you should have two channels where only the admins can send messages, others can only view. The first one is a channel that specifies server rules and links members to your community’s social media, as well as answering some FAQ. The second one is a channel where the full-time contributors discuss work matters. Chances are that the most active channel in your server will be the one the core team discusses matters related to work. This channel will be the one new members will be most curious to see. Therefore, be very intentional in how you communicate with each other. Remember, you are indirectly telling people what kind of behaviours are expected, encouraged and tolerated. Activity 7: Spread the word! At this stage, you would want to set clear paths with different levels of involvement for members. The paths should be divided exponentially — each successive path should have a much higher amount of work and reward than the previous one. What are some ways people can participate in your community? What is the easiest way to participate in your community? This could be as simple as interacting with your posts or creating social media content. For example, members could translate articles, create TikToks or explainers, etc. Ideally you should have three paths. The first path should be something that anyone can do with just a few minutes of investment per day. The second path is something that would ideally require a couple hours a week. The third path is something that would require an hour or more per day. This is also a great way to spread the word about your community and discover your most enthusiastic members. Ideally when expanding your team, you should choose from this pool first. Activity 8: Give everyone an opportunity to lead. The best communities are built of leaders. Empowering everyone with an opportunity to lead does wonders for your community dynamic, not to mention that it makes your community more resilient. Create a ritual where community members get to lead in turns. You could, for example, choose a different member to host your weekly internal calls. You could also involve your top contributors to critical meetings or take their opinions in meta-admin matters. Decide and create a totem for your community. Present the community with a task to decide upon and create a totem for your community. This could be an NFT, a physical object, an event or anything else. The idea is get the community to work out the details and execute the task together. From choosing the format, to the design, to the actual creation and then its distribution — these are all opportunities for people to hone and display their leadership skills. Making decisions The faster your decision making, the longer your community will survive. This is because making decisions inject energy in your community. They are a marker of movement and progress, which is the best motivator for any community member. Activity 9: Document your decision-making process. Get everyone onboard with quick decision making. Whether a decision was right or wrong is something that is only discovered far in the future. While deciding on the **********theoretical********** best option, you indirectly decide on ***********concretely*********** slower execution. This saps your community’s morale, which is a far more accurate predictor of your community’s death than making a wrong decision. Introduce the idea of schelling points. Promote a decision making process that encourages members to first think about what others are most likely to decide, and then choosing that option or from that set of options, instead of thinking evaluating the options first and then choosing from them. There is a high degree of divergence in what everyone considers to be the best option, however there is low to moderate convergence in what everyone thinks ******others****** will find to be the best option. Thinking in terms of schelling points, thus, either makes the decision for you, or narrows down your options which is another step to quick decision making. Finally, document your process. Create a separate document that summarises you decision making processes. This should ideally fit in a page, and couple even be appended to your manifesto. This is will benefit the new members in understanding how things are done in your community, and are good reference points in times of confusion or disagreement. Activity 10: Setup a governance process. Decide how to give governance power in your community. This is best done through membership NFTs, since these are easy to setup and manage as your community grows over time. rep3’s platform enables communities to setup membership badges and a Gnosis Safe in a few clicks, which saves you the trouble of figuring out and setting these up separately. Membership NFT based governance also doesn’t require a large amount of setup upfront like that required to launch tokens (deciding on supply, creating liquidity pools, fair distribution, etc.) and saves your community from governance attacks. Lastly, this is also a good time to setup token gated spaces in your Discord server, and explore token-gated collaboration tools such as Clarity or Charmverse. (link these here) Choose a platform where members can show up and vote. We suggest using Snapshot, since it is the default for all communities and is the easiest to setup. This is also the right time to set a formal proposal process that encourages members to share ideas, form comprehensive proposals and table them. Resolving conflicts As mentioned above, conflicts are a natural part of working and living in groups. It is not the conflict, but rather the community’s response to it that has path altering effects on the community’s trajectory. The idea of all conflict resolution is to reconciliation by going to back to a point where everyone was in harmony. Activity 11: Elect an ombudsman in your community. The ideal ombudsman is the individual that the community deems impartial enough to resolve conflicts. Have your community vote upon and decide upon an ombudsman. Work closely with this person to propose a conflict resolution playbook that documents the conflict-resolution process. A sample process could look like this — the parties involved submit description of the facts of the event and their intrepretations of it. The ombudsman then reviews these decisions and then goes into discussion with the two parties, starting with getting them to agree on facts, and then reconcile their differences thereon. Activity 12: Define your community’s code of conduct. Prevention is better than cure. It is much easier to define and nudge your members towards proper ways of conducting themselves in the community, than it is to address someone breaking the code of conduct. A code of conduct is just a solidified, objective and a thorough description of your values. In addition to it should also list the basics i.e. a complete intolerance of any kind of discrimination (based on religion, gender of choice, perceived skill level, etc.) and behaviour that may contribute to creating an unhealthy atmosphere (unwelcome sexual attention, harassment or trolling, bullying people or taking sides, etc.) Having a code of conduct that is not enforced is worse than having one that is. Be extremely clear about escalation practices. For example, institute a warning system in place, where each digression from the code of conduct is taken as one warning. Then, make it so it is easy for everyone to track the warnings of members ********without******** knowing what they were warned for. This could be done through badges that convey a warning was issued without any more details. You could also institute bans instead of or along with a warning system. As founding members of the community, it is your imperative to hold safe spaces for everyone and anyone to come forth and share their concerns, no matter how trivial or grave. Make sure you along with the ombudsman are aligned on this, and communicate it frequently with the community. Activity 13: Revisit activity 1. In communities, the earliest members often set the tone of interactions for everyone that comes after. New members often look at the communication patterns of early members to see what is accepted and what isn’t. Here, your actions speak much, much louder than your words. Whatever precedent you set for your community, there is a high chance that someone takes it to its extremes. For example, if you have a culture of tolerating playful banter, then down the line you will see someone or the other take it to its extreme and outright troll or bully someone. Or, if you have a culture of shipping fast and turning around things quickly, chances are, sometimes people will not even adhere to the bare minimum standard of quality. Take a step back and think hard about this. You ideally do not have to change yourself completely for your community. You just need to be careful in upholding boundaries or standards. That’s why the biggest communities have zero tolerance for things that are common in small groups of people, simply because it broadens the “grey area” which is were most transgressions of a community’s code of conduct lie. Remember, people are more concerned with not looking bad in front of their peers than gaining their praise. Often, not acknowledging and encouraging the unwanted behaviour by anyone, ever is a really strong way to prevent transgressions of your code of conduct, or address them swiftly if they ever happen. Common Roadblocks The Dip by Seth Godin The Dip by Seth Godin A community in the valley stage gets slowly gets itself exposed to reality for the first time. This can be a tough process to navigate. Things might *****feel***** like they are not working or breaking down, when in fact they are. And if they aren’t, then sometimes it is tough to actually understand *****what***** is breaking down and why. When in doubt, always look if the reason can be attributed to internal complexity or external. Chances are, the roadblock you face is ideally a result of both internal and external complexity. The aim then is to do what you can control. You always have a control on how you work and approach problems. Focus on this. Set, revisit or revise processes. Consciously steer your culture. It may be tempting to get right to “what matters” and move on to the next thing. But the importance of spending time on your culture in this stage cannot be overstated. This may just be the last time you have any sort of proper control over it. Conclusion Contrary to the first stage where things seem “up only”, a valley starts with a decline and eventually ends up with things looking not-so-bad. You go from what is essentially one small unit of five or six people to ****two**** small units of this size. Your community now onwards can be best seen as a collection of similar-sized units. If you have been careful, you have templatized this process of growth. You would have also become comfortable with putting yourself out there, and have learnt the true value of the feedback gained from exposing your ideas to the world. You have most probably revisited some aspect of your narrative or your values, and you have a space that your community calls home. You have processes for collective decision making and managing your finances in an open way. Your mission seems to have the potential to resonate with people — not because you simply think so, but because you have signs that point in this direction. Things will pick up the pace soon, and the way you look at your community is going to change. "],["phase-3-the-carnival.html", "Phase 3: The Carnival Setting the Stage Time to Perform! Common Roadblocks Conclusion", " Phase 3: The Carnival “No one can whistle a symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it.” – H.E. Luccock Carnival Chaos Carnival Chaos Communities that don’t die in the desert usually die in the valley. And the ones that die in neither see their persistence rewarded by reaching the carnival. It is fun and exciting to say the least. A welcome change. Your narrative seems to have found its audience, howsoever small that may be. There is a regular pace at which your community is adding more members. You may even see a spike in your engagement on social media. The mindset that sustained you in the desert and the valley is not of much use here. This is because the carnival is characterised as phase of abundance. Opportunities that seemed scarce — like those to recruit people or fill your treasury — are available in plenty. Let’s take a closer look. Setting the Stage It is tempting to overindulge in the carnival. Your community might want to spend more money and do more things. At the same time, things move faster than ever. More members join by the day, which brings the risk of diluting your community’s atmosphere. The key to making the most of the carnival is sticking to the plan. This does not mean not trying new things, but in a space full of distractions it always helps to remember what you initially set out to do. Encourage participation Today, the the lines between a customer, contributor and a community member are more blurred than ever. People that join as contributors might turn into customers. Customers that come for the product or service might choose to join the community and contribute to its mission. Your job as the community founder now is to facilitate the environment where people drift between customer, contributor or a community member easily. This means your leadership must be like that of a party host, instead of a troop leader. Leadership as hospitality is all about making people comfortable and included. In this regard, you need to ensure that people have ample opportunities to add to the conversation or contribute to a project with little to no friction. Acknowledge outliers Power laws apply everywhere, and they apply to your community too. As you grow, you need to develop the skill to discern members that have an outsized impact on things. This need not necessarily be in terms of output. Some people might be great at shipping — which is easy to notice — but there are others that are great at uplifting the community or keeping things glued together. This requires deep observation. After you have found out these people, make sure you do everything in your power to make them feel acknowledged and appreciated. Demonstrate progress Visible progress is a key driver of motivation. Besides making your community seem lively, it makes your community fun and keeps the morale high. Demonstrating progress need not always be about communicating output. It can be done in many ways. A regular cadence of meetings that are open to the broader public are a great way to do so. The best communities also spend a lot of time documenting and articulating themselves — whether in video or text form — and putting it out there for the world to see. Time to Perform! Encouraging participation Ideally, your community should have different levels and domains of involvement that are easy to enter and exit. Activity 14: Create functional teams. Not having a tall hierarchy does not mean not having a structure. As your community grows, it is important to structure yourself for maximum productivity. Identify members from your early members to lead these functional teams. The type of functional teams you have depends on what your community intends to do. These would probably be clear by seeing what your early members spend time on when engaging in your communities. Regardless of what you do, it is highly advisable to have a marketing and a governance team. Then, depending on your goals, you could have an engineering team, a design team, a growth team, etc. Cultivate these leaders by supporting them in operating their teams. Leading a functional team is just another version of leading a community. Share your early lessons with team leaders and inform them of any roadblocks that they might face. Activity 15: Create a check-in ritual. Leadership as hospitality means making sure everyone is having a good time. Encourage your pod leaders to look at their role as that of a party host. Without asking, how are some ways they can find out if a member is having fun or not? In the party that is your community, what is the equivalent of sitting alone in a corner without eating, drinking or using your phone? This could like someone suddenly stopping their daily gm’s. Or someone that is not as thorough or thoughtful in their responses, or maybe they reacted to all messages and they have stopped doing so. Or they used to share a lot of memes and music but now they don’t. Look for patterns and try to notice when people break them. If they do so, it is probably a good idea to check-in with them. Acknowledging outliers Community members with outsized impacts are the engine of sustenance. Acknowledging them goes a long way. Activity 16: Identify outliers. You need to take a hard look at your community to identify these outliers. Who are the people that take the most amount of initiative? Who are the people that have highest, and most visible impact on community output? There might be a developer that pumps out PR after PR, or a contributor that always has new content ideas. There are also others that seem unproductive and more “behind the scenes”, yet they command the most amount of respect or power in your community. Some outliers could also look like people whose presence lights up the whole space. This could be due to their nature or just the way they conduct themselves. They always have something to say and leave the chat buzzing with action. Activity 17: Appreciate and acknowledge the effort of your outliers. There several ways of appreciating and acknowledging your members. Publicly recognise your members, but be careful not to over-do it. There is a certain influence early members have in any community. As community founders, even though you may not have a lot of power on paper, what you say holds a lot of weight in your community. Use this to your benefit. Publicly recognise outstanding effort of your community members. But be sparing in your appreciation. Too much and you risk reducing its impact. Having said that, don’t shy away from individually appreciating members. Do this as much as you can. It will not only make them feel good, but also make your members more open to critical feedback when you need to give so. If possible, create a compensation strategy to monetarily reward members. When possible, you should always go for rewards that intrinsically motivate people. But some people just have some extrinsic motivations. For them, the prospect of earning money is more valuable than a sense of belonging. This is also fine. Monetarily rewarding members makes them take participation more seriously, and may even bump up your community in the list of projects they are involved with. Create a proposal to earmark a portion of your treasury for member contributions. Then, work with team leaders to create and maintain open task boards and processes to evaluate work and disburse payments. Demonstrating progress Don’t be afraid to get meta when demonstrating progress. Activity 18: Articulate your learnings from growing your community. One of the best ways of demonstrating progress is to simply articulate your personal learnings. People are more intrigued with the backstage details of what you do, instead of the thing that you actually do.[1] Create a personal blog that gives commentary on your process as a community steward/founder. Try to go as specific as you can in these posts. People may not be interested in *****your***** community, but they will surely be interested in how they could grow one. Sharing your learnings is a great tactic to subtly market your community to newer audiences. Activity 19: Create a regular cadence of progress updates. Make you share anything your community accomplishes or completes as regular, predictable intervals. Post weekly updates. The best manifestation of demonstrating progress is weekly updates. There is something about a community that shares what they’ve been upto and the challenges they are facing. Try to open your communication channels to the world. Nothing demonstrates progress like letting the world peep into your office. This might not be possible for all communities, but there is certainly a version of this that you can implement. You may just open up the channel where you discuss and execute proposals. Or you can have some of your internal discussions open to the public. Common Roadblocks Sometimes it may feel like this Sometimes it may feel like this While the valley challenged your commitment, the carnival will challenge your sanity. All your processes and rituals get battletested and reveal interesting things. Your job here is to acknowledge the facts that are revealed and take action on them if necessary. For example, you may realize that some rituals that worked well in earlier phases just don’t scale. Or that there are certain changes that must be made to your workflows, or that a particular thing you did was great in attracting members. Whatever this maybe, consciously analysing it and thinking about what you can do it (and if you should do anything about it) is much better than simply ignoring it. Conclusion While you entered the carnival with a two small teams of five to six people, you find yourself leaving with ten or more such small teams. In a short span of time, your community has not double, but grown several fold. Your treasury has some money in it, no matter the amount. Your forums are populated with lively discourse. You have a dependable governance process. You have self-managing teams in your community, and most important your tangible power as a community founder has diminished. These are all signs of a healthy community. Things have somewhat stabilised — dare you say, even plateaued — and now you need to focus on maintaining and guarding the castle you have built. [1] For example, the first thing one wonders when they meet a startup founder is not some specific detail of their company, but rather the backstage or the meta details of how they got started, what issues they faced, etc. The same goes for your community. Sharing your learnings is, in a way, a great introduction to your community. "],["phase-4-the-village.html", "Phase 4: The Village Setting the Stage Time to Perform! Common Roadblocks Conclusion", " Phase 4: The Village “Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.” – Will Rogers A village in Switzerland A village in Switzerland After the hustle and bustle of the carnival, you arrive at the village. Things are calmer and more predictable. They have also slowed down. New people come and old people leave in an expected, orderly fashion. You have passed, or are going to pass Dunbar’s number. There is a high chance that there are chunks of people in your community completely unaware of each other. You have made a name and a space for yourself. Now is the time to form alliances and exploring new territories while maintaining what you have built. Setting the Stage If you have reached this stage, your community has succeeded in making a name and carving out a space for itself. You must now shift your focus to forming alliances and exploring new territories, while maintaining what you have built. Maintain your community Let’s revisit the idea of communities being gardens. A vibrant and a colourful garden requires high levels of maintenance. This means regularly tending to its plants and flowers; periodically removing weeds, insects and pests; and, occasionally fending the wild animal that threatens to walk over and destroy everything. Similarly, you should focus on improving the experience of participating in your community, reinforcing positive behaviours and being on the lookout for subtle winds of change that could turn into storms in the future. Expand your influence As your community matures, you either find yourself having achieved the goal you initially set out to achieve, or, you find yourself no longer captivated by that mission. In either cases, there is a tangible sense of stagnation in your community. You must address this by introducing ideas of expansion and focussing on a different or a bigger goal. Is there a way to player a large role in the ecosystem you are a part of? Is there something new on the horizon that you can participate in? In this stage of your community, the bonds among the members are strong enough to survive an update to or a complete change of your north star. Time to Perform! The village is a comfortable place to stay. It is also where most communities go and die. You must continue to fan curiosity and keep the explorer spirit alive. Approaching maintenance Taking a closer look at how your community moves. Activity 19: Guarding the gates. If you have reached the village, the raw experience of participating in your community is validate. Now, you must refine the onboarding and offboarding process. Optimize your onboarding flow. A smooth onboarding flow encourages new members to become participants instead of spectators. Revisit your initiation rituals. Now that you have more resources at your disposal, how can you improve this experience? Perhaps, have a regular onboarding call weekly or fortnightly. Assign buddies to each new member to help them navigate the community. Or, personally reach out to new members and schedule a brief conversation with them. Optimize your offboarding flow. A smooth offboarding flow turns leaving members into assets for the community. How do you ensure that members leave on a good note? Be open to any feedback you receive from exiting members, and do your best to help them go wherever it is that they want to go next. It may not benefit you immediately, but it will create goodwill with your exiting member that will payback in due time. Activity 20: Get really good at giving and receiving feedback. Remember, community founders have great levels of influence and are held in high regard by the community members. As your community grows in this phase, most members view you as the village elder. Use this power to wisely. Learn to give great feedback. Great feedback comes from a place of empathy and contributes to the growth of the other person. Remember, it is about what they ****did**** — never about who they are. Check your emotions before giving feedback. It is extra important to choose your words carefully, since most people on the receiving end of feedback are subconsciously defensive to some extent. You want them to focus on what your say, not the delivery of it. Be as objective as you can. This means highlighting anything that is out of the ordinary — whether good or bad. Backing your arguments with examples/instances is the most helpful thing you can do. Learn to take great feedback. When seeking feedback, it is important to be clear about your intentions — do you want to know the truth or are you just seeking approval? Don’t let having strong opinions about your work shut you from new or different ways to do things. The idea of feedback is to improve the quality of the end-product, not make a judgement on your ideas or your working style. A good practice in communities is to setup anonymous polls within pods or teams, where anyone can come and voice their opinions or ideas. Then, the pod of team leads can bring these up with the community and initiate discussion if required. Expanding your influence By this stage, your community would have amassed a decent following in the larger ecosystem you are a part of. A great way to maintain the novelty and motivation of participating and running communities is to partner with other communities that share your interests and/or goals. Activity 21: Take a stock of things. Notice what has changed. Since the time you started your community to today, what has changed in your external environment? What are some new things — ideas, tools and technologies — that have come up? Internally, what were some unexpected consequences of the decisions your community made? These could be decisions around kicking members, doubling down on a particular bet, creating rituals, etc. For example, you may notice that the vibe of your community changes after highly visible people leave. Note the effect of such a change. Sometimes, incentives optimize for the wrong type of behaviour. What are the explicit and implicit incentive structures in your community? What are some ways people have gamed this? What new rituals or processes have sprung up? Are any of them unhealthy or unproductive? Have a system to evaluate new ideas. Communities of this size come with their own set of pros and cons. What is something that your community is the best at? What is something that your community absolutely cannot do? Being aware of your constraints helps you evaluate new ideas — they might be great in general, but they could not be the most beneficial path of action for your community. Activity 22: Host or coodinate community-wide events. This one is straightforward — digital communities are the closest we have come to emulating the feeling irl togetherness, but they still cannot replace the real thing. Take the charge in coordinating an irl meetup for your community members that are open to do so. This need not even be something on its own — a good idea is to meet or host a side-event at any of the tentpole events that happen in your ecosystem around the year. For example, ETH Denver has become a popular event for many crypto communities to gather and meet irl for the first time. Explore similar events in your area if all your members are in the same country or continent. Common Roadblocks A situation like this can easily be avoided. A situation like this can easily be avoided. The biggest roadblocks to your community’s progress at this stage are politics and stagnation. As your community grows in size, so do the number of unofficial sub-groups that go on to sow the seeds of destruction. Identify the key members that disrupt the harmony of your community and make an effort to address their behaviour early on. Obviously, mere disagreement or a difference of opinion does not equal disruption. But, individuals that behave in clannish ways or communicate unhealthily are surely disruptive. Make sure you deal with these individuals early on — either by assimilating them into your community or helping them find opportunities they are better suited for. The next roadblock you shall face going forward is falling into the trap of indecisiveness as to what you should focus on. This can be individual as well as communal indecision. The reason behind such indecision is mostly an outdated way of evaluating opportunities. There is a certain inertia that comes with growth, and this must be dealt with head first. Conclusion By now, the operations of your community are mostly locked down. You have a rhythm to your social media strategy, you’re building in public/getting the broader public involved as much as you can (through virtual events, progress reports and content) and you have a healthy atmosphere in your digital headquarters (which could be Google Workspace and Discord, or a bespoke mix of open source tools). You have a list of rituals that make participation fun, and you have a set processes that facilitate idea generation, constructive discussion and active voting. Congratulations! Most communities that start don’t live to see this day. But in all communities, big and small, the stages outlined in the previous posts are somewhat common. Sure, the duration of each phase may vary greatly — some communities develop on a slow-burn over years while others bubble up in weeks. It also depends on your community’s focus. Are you trying to build or improve a product? Are you trying to provide some sort of service? Is it primarily a space for people to discuss a niche interest? All this affects your trajectory and your growth. Also, it can change anytime! The only thing to remember is that any community is like an evolving, living, breathing entity that changes with time. As is with art, one “finishes” or “perfects” a community, they simply abandon it. This is a thoughtful comparison. Community building is the greatest art of the 21st century. This is because of two reasons — first, is the development in communication technology, that make discovering others with shared interests very, very easy. Second, is the breakdown in traditional community structures that has led to people increasingly finding themselves in their community of choice. Artists, creators and ideas have unparalleled pull today. It is our imperative to take full advantage of this, and make the world a better place. 0.0.1 Sources and Further Reading: The Laws of Lorecore - ZORA ZINE Life After Lifestyle 1,000 True Fans?
