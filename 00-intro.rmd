## The Imperative of Our Times {-}

The Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link, or [The WELL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL) is one of the oldest virtual communities still operational. Launched in 1985, in just 8 short years, it grew to 7,000 members and a staff of 12 full-time employees with a gross annual income of [$2 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL#cite_note-:5-2). These are interesting statistics, considering the fact that the foundations of modern day internet — that enable such communities — didn’t exist then.

One participant of The WELL, Howard Rheingold, wrote a book aptly titled The Virtual Community, where he discussed the vagaries of life pertaining to online communities. The book’s prescience is uncanny.

Almost three decades later, Howard’s observations have become reality. People addicted to communicating online, trolling each other, coordinating together for a greater cause and even finding love — these were as common occurences back then as they are now.

What’s more interesting though, was the focus of Howard’s work. He wanted to investigate what made a stream of digital messages, turn into a community as good as any other. When conversation is stripped of its social cues, how does one create the feeling of warm connection with words?

This series of articles on community building aims to answer this very question in ample detail. Exiting the domains of Big Tech, people today are increasingly turning away from mindless consumption. In a world of remote everything, people are seeking and creating communities that ***do*** things.

Be it WSB traders, DAO contributors or activists in Signal groups, the meta of the times has been participating and growing communities. This could attributed partly to the nature of things — narratives that provide meaning to people’s lives have withered, leading to increased isolation. 

What was once a family sharing one TV, is now everyone sitting separately with their own screens. Technology has gone from a facilitator of “real-life” activity, to a replacement of the same. As a result, we are now finding meaning in these screens, which has turned participating and growing virtual communities consequential for our well-being.


## Taking a Closer Look {-}

There are several peculiarities to virtual communities. They are like streams of data, sustained by prompt replies, a medium where multiple people can talk at the same time and still make sense. Despite this, owing to the constancy of human nature, virtual communities aren’t much different from “real-life” communities.

They each have their set of participatory and initiation rituals, and a set of rules that facilitate the integration of new people as well as the exit of the old. They also go through the same stages of growth — ones that we will discuss in more detail in the upcoming articles — and face some of the same issues. 

To be best prepared to understand and tackle these issues, we must take a closer look at some of the key ideas behind communities.

### Communities are Gestalts {-}

Great communities are gestalts, providing members with value they cannot access or create on their own. This is best witnessed in our usage on social media. A great chunk of the value of web2 social media, especially of UGC applications such as TikTok, Instagram or YouTube lie in the communities they foster.

The comments sections of each post indirectly add to your experience of consuming that piece of content. You may be able to consume that content elsewhere, but you certainly won’t get the same value out of doing so. 

web2 social media comments sections — content can be consumed anywhere, but the community is only on the platform.

### Communities are Living Beings {-}

The best communities are participatory and emergent, and the best community builders are approach their work as gardeners instead of builders. Taking this analogy forward, a great way to think about communities are thinking about slime molds. That is to say, a community is never “complete”.

It will always be messy and ever-evolving, and each stage of it is beautiful in its own right.

### Communities are Spaces {-}

Objectively seen, communities create spaces. A space is defined by its boundaries and rules, that classifies everyone into in-groups and out-groups. The primary purpose of a space is to maintain a certain atmosphere for the people within, not the exclusion of those outside of it.

This is a key concept to grasp. The latter definition leads to weak communities with extrinsically motivated members (inclusion in the group makes them look good). The former definition leads to strong communities with intrinsically motivated members (inclusion in the group makes them feel good).

## What sustains a community? {-}

Your community’s garden must be tended to regularly. These are key activities that sustain communities in the long-run.

### Narrative Building {-}

Communities that achieve things have compelling narratives greater than any one individual. It is a north-star that attracts the right kind of people, and facilitates decision-making and coordinated action.

The only thing more important than a compelling narrative though, is the ability for members to contribute to it. Fortunately, the nature of virtual communities facilitates discussion and enables groups to collectively decide and act on agreed-upon goals.

### Sharing Power {-}

Just like how a gardener must be careful in placing seeds to ensure all of them have a healthy growth, similarly community stewards must be mindful to give each member the space to fully grow.

This means giving each member the opportunity to “take charge”, and to cultivate a space that takes everyone’s opinions into consideration at all times. Today, the lines between a customer, contributor and a community member are more blurred than ever. Communities that acknowledge invisible power dynamics and address them go the furthest.

### Iterative Processes {-}

As communities grow, it becomes more and more difficult to arrive at consensus and actually get stuff done. That is why, iterative processes that focus on regular output do a great job of closing the loop and fighting stagnation.

For this, a mindset of “good enough” is better than “the best”. Good enough work, iterated upon, has a higher chance of achieving its true potential, than work that is painstakingly created trying to perfect every detail (or even just a few).

> There was a fellow who kind of ran the mailing list, who died a few years ago by the name of [Jon Postel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel), and everybody trusted him to not be in a particular faction. So I think the philosophy behind the people who created the internet was rough consensus and running code. So rough consensus is important, because anyone who's participated in a consensus based activities that are strict consensus, finds that they go on and on and on.

## The Illusion of Control {-}

Around the same time as The WELL, the first iterations of a metaverse were created by [Lucasfilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm) in [Habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(video_game)). Users controlled their avatar that moved around in a virtual world. 

In a paper published by the programmers of Lucasfilm Habitat, titled [The Lessons of Lucasfilm's Habitat](https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Virtual_Worlds/LucasfilmHabitat.html), [Chip Morningstar and F. Randall Farmer](http://www.communities.com/picture/randchip.gif) talked about designing and managing this virtual community of tens of thousands of people.

Their main lesson from working on the project was follows:

> …***detailed central planning is impossible**; don’t even try it. Create the tools for users to build their own society, and **let the users tell you what they want to do**, because that is what the users…will do, no matter how hard you try to structure some other purpose. The more people we involved in something, the less in control we were. 

We shifted into a style of operations in which we let the players themselves drive the direction of the design. This proved far more effective. Instead of trying to push the community in the direction we thought it should go, an exercise rather like herding mice, **we tried to observe what people were doing and aid them in it**.*

As community stewards, our job is set the necessary context and background for a community to flourish. In the beginning, it may feel like you are in control since nothing happens that makes you feel otherwise.

But as your community grows, you realize that the only way to reconcile the ensuing chaos is to give up any idea of control, and aid the community to do what it wants to do.

## Moving Forward {-}
 
Any community goes through four key stages in its lifecycle. This series has four more articles, each concerned with one of the four stages. In this piece, we touched upon the history of virtual communities, our learnings from these experiments, and key approaches to thinking about growing communities.

We must look at any community as a garden — an organic space that is ever-evolving and ever-changing. We need to have a compelling narrative that members can contribute to. We need to consciously make an effort to share power, and always favour what’s “good enough” over “what’s perfect”.

So how does such a approach to community building look like? In the following posts, we shall go into the weeds, introducing new concepts, walking you through tactical exercises and informing you about key roadblocks to expect and watch out for. LFG!
