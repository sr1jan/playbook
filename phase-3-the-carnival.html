<p><a href="https://www.cliftonhill.com/sites/default/files/places/primary-images/carnivalchaos1.jpg">Carnival Chaos</a></p>
<p>Communities that don’t die in the desert usually die in the valley. And the ones that die in neither see their persistence rewarded by reaching the carnival.</p>
<p>It is fun and exciting to say the least. A welcome change.</p>
<p>Your narrative seems to have found its audience, howsoever small that may be. There is a regular pace at which your community is adding more members. You may even see a spike in your engagement on social media.</p>
<p>The mindset that sustained you in the desert and the valley is not of much use here. This is because the carnival is characterised as phase of abundance. Opportunities that seemed scarce — like those to recruit people or fill your treasury — are available in plenty.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<div id="setting-the-stage-2" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Setting the Stage<a href="phase-3-the-carnival.html#setting-the-stage-2" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>It is tempting to overindulge in the carnival. Your community might want to spend more money and do more things. At the same time, things move faster than ever. More members join by the day, which brings the risk of diluting your community’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>The key to making the most of the carnival is sticking to the plan. This does not mean not trying new things, but in a space full of distractions it always helps to remember what you initially set out to do.</p>
<div id="encourage-participation" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Encourage participation<a href="phase-3-the-carnival.html#encourage-participation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Today, the the lines between a customer, contributor and a community member are more blurred than ever. People that join as contributors might turn into customers. Customers that come for the product or service might choose to join the community and contribute to its mission.</p>
<p>Your job as the community founder now is to facilitate the environment where people drift between customer, contributor or a community member easily. This means your leadership must be like that of a party host, instead of a troop leader.</p>
<p>Leadership as hospitality is all about making people comfortable and included. In this regard, you need to ensure that people have ample opportunities to add to the conversation or contribute to a project with little to no friction.</p>
</div>
<div id="acknowledge-outliers" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Acknowledge outliers<a href="phase-3-the-carnival.html#acknowledge-outliers" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Power laws apply everywhere, and they apply to your community too.</p>
<p>As you grow, you need to develop the skill to discern members that have an outsized impact on things. This need not necessarily be in terms of output.</p>
<p>Some people might be great at shipping — which is easy to notice — but there are others that are great at uplifting the community or keeping things glued together. This requires deep observation. After you have found out these people, make sure you do everything in your power to make them feel acknowledged and appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div id="demonstrate-progress" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Demonstrate progress<a href="phase-3-the-carnival.html#demonstrate-progress" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Visible progress is a key driver of motivation. Besides making your community seem lively, it makes your community fun and keeps the morale high.</p>
<p>Demonstrating progress need not always be about communicating output. It can be done in many ways. A regular cadence of meetings that are open to the broader public are a great way to do so.</p>
<p>The best communities also spend a lot of time documenting and articulating themselves — whether in video or text form — and putting it out there for the world to see.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="time-to-perform-2" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Time to Perform!<a href="phase-3-the-carnival.html#time-to-perform-2" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<div id="encouraging-participation" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Encouraging participation<a href="phase-3-the-carnival.html#encouraging-participation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Ideally, your community should have different levels and domains of involvement that are easy to enter and exit.</p>
<p><em>Activity 14: Create functional teams.</em></p>
<p>Not having a tall hierarchy does not mean not having a structure. As your community grows, it is important to structure yourself for maximum productivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify members from your early members to lead these functional teams.
<ul>
<li>The type of functional teams you have depends on what your community intends to do. These would probably be clear by seeing what your early members spend time on when engaging in your communities.</li>
<li>Regardless of what you do, it is highly advisable to have a marketing and a governance team. Then, depending on your goals, you could have an engineering team, a design team, a growth team, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cultivate these leaders by supporting them in operating their teams.
<ul>
<li>Leading a functional team is just another version of leading a community. Share your early lessons with team leaders and inform them of any roadblocks that they might face.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Activity 15: Create a check-in ritual.</em></p>
<p>Leadership as hospitality means making sure everyone is having a good time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage your pod leaders to look at their role as that of a party host.
<ul>
<li>Without asking, how are some ways they can find out if a member is having fun or not? In the party that is your community, what is the equivalent of sitting alone in a corner without eating, drinking or using your phone?</li>
<li>This could like someone suddenly stopping their daily gm’s. Or someone that is not as thorough or thoughtful in their responses, or maybe they reacted to all messages and they have stopped doing so. Or they used to share a lot of memes and music but now they don’t.</li>
<li>Look for patterns and try to notice when people break them. If they do so, it is probably a good idea to check-in with them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="acknowledging-outliers" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Acknowledging outliers<a href="phase-3-the-carnival.html#acknowledging-outliers" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Community members with outsized impacts are the engine of sustenance. Acknowledging them goes a long way.</p>
<p><em>Activity 16: Identify outliers.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You need to take a hard look at your community to identify these outliers.
<ul>
<li>Who are the people that take the most amount of initiative? Who are the people that have highest, and most visible impact on community output?</li>
<li>There might be a developer that pumps out PR after PR, or a contributor that always has new content ideas.</li>
<li>There are also others that seem unproductive and more “behind the scenes”, yet they command the most amount of respect or power in your community.</li>
<li>Some outliers could also look like people whose presence lights up the whole space. This could be due to their nature or just the way they conduct themselves. They always have something to say and leave the chat buzzing with action.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Activity 17: Appreciate and acknowledge the effort of your outliers.</em></p>
<p>There several ways of appreciating and acknowledging your members.</p>
<ul>
<li>Publicly recognise your members, but be careful not to over-do it.
<ul>
<li>There is a certain influence early members have in any community. As community founders, even though you may not have a lot of power on paper, what you say holds a lot of weight in your community.</li>
<li>Use this to your benefit. Publicly recognise outstanding effort of your community members. But be sparing in your appreciation. Too much and you risk reducing its impact.</li>
<li>Having said that, don’t shy away from individually appreciating members. Do this as much as you can. It will not only make them feel good, but also make your members more open to critical feedback when you need to give so.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If possible, create a compensation strategy to monetarily reward members.
<ul>
<li>When possible, you should always go for rewards that intrinsically motivate people. But some people just have some extrinsic motivations. For them, the prospect of earning money is more valuable than a sense of belonging.</li>
<li>This is also fine. Monetarily rewarding members makes them take participation more seriously, and may even bump up your community in the list of projects they are involved with.</li>
<li>Create a proposal to earmark a portion of your treasury for member contributions. Then, work with team leaders to create and maintain open task boards and processes to evaluate work and disburse payments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Demonstrating progress<a href="phase-3-the-carnival.html#demonstrating-progress" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Don’t be afraid to get meta when demonstrating progress.</p>
<p><em>Activity 18: Articulate your learnings from growing your community.</em></p>
<p>One of the best ways of demonstrating progress is to simply articulate your personal learnings. People are more intrigued with the backstage details of what you do, instead of the thing that you actually do.[1]</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a personal blog that gives commentary on your process as a community steward/founder.
<ul>
<li>Try to go as specific as you can in these posts. People may not be interested in *****your***** community, but they will surely be interested in how <em>they</em> could grow one. Sharing your learnings is a great tactic to subtly market your community to newer audiences.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Activity 19: Create a regular cadence of progress updates.</em></p>
<p>Make you share anything your community accomplishes or completes as regular, predictable intervals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Post weekly updates.
<ul>
<li>The best manifestation of demonstrating progress is weekly updates. There is something about a community that shares what they’ve been upto and the challenges they are facing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try to open your communication channels to the world.

<li>Nothing demonstrates progress like letting the world peep into your office. This might not be possible for all communities, but there is certainly a version of this that you can implement. You may just open up the channel where you discuss and execute proposals. Or you can have some of your internal discussions open to the public.</li>

<p>While the valley challenged your commitment, the carnival will challenge your sanity. All your processes and rituals get battletested and reveal interesting things. Your job here is to acknowledge the facts that are revealed and take action on them if necessary.</p>
<p>For example, you may realize that some rituals that worked well in earlier phases just don’t scale. Or that there are certain changes that must be made to your workflows, or that a particular thing you did was great in attracting members.</p>
<p>Whatever this maybe, consciously analysing it and thinking about what you can do it (and if you should do anything about it) is much better than simply ignoring it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion<a href="phase-3-the-carnival.html#conclusion-2" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>While you entered the carnival with a two small teams of five to six people, you find yourself leaving with ten or more such small teams. In a short span of time, your community has not double, but grown several fold.</p>
<p>Your treasury has some money in it, no matter the amount. Your forums are populated with lively discourse. You have a dependable governance process. You have self-managing teams in your community, and most important your tangible power as a community founder has diminished.</p>
<p>These are all signs of a healthy community.</p>
<p>Things have somewhat stabilised — dare you say, even plateaued — and now you need to focus on maintaining and guarding the castle you have built.</p>
<hr />
<p>[1] For example, the first thing one wonders when they meet a startup founder is not some specific detail of their company, but rather the backstage or the meta details of how they got started, what issues they faced, etc. The same goes for your community. Sharing your learnings is, in a way, a great introduction to your community.</p>
